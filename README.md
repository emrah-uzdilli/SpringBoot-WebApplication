DevSecOps provides automation from the beginning of a process that reduces the
chance of any mistakes, which can lead to vulnerabilities. The DevSecOps motto is;
“Software,safer,sooner”.

The CI/CD pipeline is designed to streamline software development and deployment making it more
efficient, automated and secure.
